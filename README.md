# Media AV Portal

[![Build Status](https://drone.fpfis.eu/api/badges/openeuropa/media_avportal/status.svg?branch=8.x-1.x)](https://drone.fpfis.eu/openeuropa/media_avportal)
[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/openeuropa/media_avportal.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/openeuropa/media_avportal)

Media AV Portal adds the [European Audiovisual Services](http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/) as a supported media provider.

# Mock service

The project also comes with a test module that provides a mock to the remote AV Portal service. Meaning that tests do not have to be run against the remote service but local resources are used.

## How to use the mock

Enable the `media_avportal_mock` inside a given test and all HTTP requests going to AV Portal API will be intercepted automatically. These, then, will return predefined responses that can be inspected in the `responses` folder of the mock module.

By default, there are 3 types of requests that are mocked:

* A default request with no options
* A request for a given resource (the options contain the `ref` key)
* A request that searches for a given term (the options contain the `kwand` key)

Additionally, any request to a resource thumbnail will return a local thumbnail image.

## Extending the mock

If another module needs to test interactions that require more responses, these can be provided via an event subscriber (to the `AvPortalMockEvent` event).

In the subscriber, 3 types of responses (in JSON format) can be provided:

* Individual resources
* Search results for a given term
* A default response to replace the existing one

As an example, you can see the subscriber that provides the default resources, `AvPortalMockEventSubscriber`.

## Installation

The recommended way of installing the module is via [Composer][2].

```bash
composer require drupal/media_avportal
```

### Enable the module

In order to enable the module in your project run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drush en media_avportal -y
```

## Development

The project contains all the necessary code and tools for an effective development process,
such as:

- All PHP development dependencies (Drupal core included) are required by [composer.json](composer.json)
- Project setup and installation can be easily handled thanks to the integration with the [Task Runner][3] project.
- All system requirements are containerized using [Docker Composer][4]

### Project setup

Download all required PHP code by running:

```bash
composer install
```

This will build a fully functional Drupal test site in the `./build` directory that can be used to develop and showcase
the module's functionality.

Before setting up and installing the site make sure to customize default configuration values by copying [runner.yml.dist](runner.yml.dist)
to `./runner.yml` and overriding relevant properties.

This will also:

- Symlink the theme in  `./build/modules/custom/media_avportal` so that it's available for the test site
- Setup Drush and Drupal's settings using values from `./runner.yml.dist`. This includes adding parameters for EULogin
- Setup PHPUnit and Behat configuration files using values from `./runner.yml.dist`

After a successful setup install the site by running:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

This will:

- Install the test site
- Enable the Media AV Portal module

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running, 
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new 
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Disable Drupal 8 caching

Manually disabling Drupal 8 caching is a laborious process that is well described [here][10].

Alternatively you can use the following Drupal Console commands to disable/enable Drupal 8 caching:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode dev  # Disable all caches.
./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode prod # Enable all caches.
```

Note: to fully disable Twig caching the following additional manual steps are required:

1. Open `./build/sites/default/services.yml`
2. Set `cache: false` in `twig.config:` property. E.g.:

```yaml
parameters:
 twig.config:
   cache: false
```

3. Rebuild Drupal cache: `./vendor/bin/drush cr`

This is due to the following [Drupal Console issue][11].
